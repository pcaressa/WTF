# WTF: Word Translation as in Forth

## (c) 2022 by Paolo Caressa

This is a toy language implemented in a simple minded but easy-to-port non idiomatic Python as a sample of classic stack techniques.

The program `wtf.py` is an interpreter that compiles a source file into an inner threaded code which is then executed.

Currently the only documentation consists in slides presented at Codemotion Milan 2022.

Hope to put soon some more information, at least a reference to the language and its implementation: the next step is to implement the language in itself.
